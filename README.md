# Where Away?

Generate a keyboard-navigable personal bookmark webpage from your bookmarks
manifest. Translates a bookmark registry into an HTML bookmark page that does
the same thing as your web browser's bookmark toolbar, except it's keyboard
navigable. The navigation is inspired by intelliJ and Excel's Alt+ shortcuts
where a number/letter is superimposed/underlined on the actions, pressing the
number/letter takes that action.
